Active Archives Sniffer, aka "aasniff"
======================================

About aasniff
-------------

Aasniff is a python application. It provides a set of tools to extract metadata
from or create metadata about http resources. The metadata is stored in an RDF
index for later reuse.

This is alpha software with known bugs. It runs, and works at least some of the
time, but use at your own risk.

For information about the installation, see INSTALL.


About Active Archives
---------------------

Active Archives inverts the paradigm of uploading resources into a centralized
server and instead allows resources to remain "active", in-place and online.
Caching and proxy functionality allow (light-weight) copies of resources to be
manipulated and preserved even as the original sources change or become
(temporarily) unavailable.

Strategically, the project aims to clarify some of the "cloudy" aspects of Web
2.0 regarding issues of licensing, sharing, ownership, access, and longevity of
online material. 

For more information about the project, see <http://activearchives.org/>.
